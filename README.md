# NestboxesRungstedlund

## Background

Rungstedlund is a small nature park in Rungsted on the east coast of Zealand. The park belongs to the museum og Karen Blixen, and has been under protection since the 1960's.

In the park over 100 nestboxes is located. For many years, these nestboxes has been studied by registrering their content and ringing the chicks. A map of the nestboxes can be seen [here](Fuglereservatet_redekasser.pdf)

However, it is a logistical nightmare to know when to check a box, since it depends on whatever was in the box last.

## Purpose

To have a simple registration system of the content of a box, and to know which boxes to check next depending on their previous content.

## Methodology

A server database will hold the content of all data.

A front-end system will allow the user to make observations to the database. 

Using the data in the database, a list can be shown that depicts which boxes to check next.
